== Why not use Git? ==

1. No library, and no one seems to be heading in that direction. Sure we (had) libgitcore, but that had its own problems and quickly fell behind git upstream.

2. Even if Git is refactored in to libgit, we'd still have a GPL library...

3. Wrong model. We are mostly versioning objections, rather than trees of objects. We don't need tree objects.

4. Pack (as it stands) isn't right for us. We need something that we can stream to/from - we don't want to have to load multiple versions in to memory, esp for big files.
